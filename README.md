# Workflow-wiZard

This project will consist of a user interface to create templates 
to be passed to the workflow generator. The workflow generator is
currently fully operational. You may find pre-built packages at
https://zowe.jfrog.io/ui/builds/Workflow%20Wizard%20::%20main

The user interface needs volunteers to see it come to life.
